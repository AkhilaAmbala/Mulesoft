7)When designing an upstream API and its implementation, the development team has been advised to not set timeouts when invoking downstream API. Because the downstream API has no SLA that can be relied upon. This is the only donwstream API dependency of that upstream API. Assume the downstream API runs uninterrupted without crashing. What is the impact of this advice?
Ans:C)A default timeout of 500 ms will automatically be applied by the Mule runtime in which the upstream API implementation executes.

8)An API has been updated in Anypoint Exchange by its API producer from version 3.1.1 to 3.2.0 following accepted semantic versioning practices and the changes have been communicated via the API's public portal. The API endpoint does NOT change in the new version. How should the developer of an API client respond to this change?
Ans:D)The API client code ONLY needs to be changed if it needs to take advantage of new features.

9)A new upstream API Is being designed to offer an SLA of 500 ms median and 800 ms maximum (99th percentile) response time.

The first of these downstream APIs offers the following SLA for its response time: median: 100 ms, 80th percentile: 500 ms, 95th percentile: 1000 ms. If possible, how can a timeout be set in the upstream API for the invocation of the first downstream API to meet the new upstream API's desired SLA?
Ans:A)Set a timeout of 100 ms; that leaves 400 ms for the other two downstream APIs to complete
